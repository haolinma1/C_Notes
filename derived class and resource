By default, each constructor in derived class call the non-argument constructor of its base class. And this applied to the copy constructor. Hence, for a copy 
  constructor in derived class, it will call the non-argument constructor in base class. (and base class constructor will first to be invoked)
  For copy assignment operator, the default copy assignment operator will call the copy assignment operator of its base class. But any custom copy assignment 
  of a derived class will not call the any copy assignment in its base class.
