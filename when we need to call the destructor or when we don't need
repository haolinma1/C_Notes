when we are not dynamically allocate memory for the object like Student lee; we don't need to call the destructor, it is the responsibility for the program to call the
destructor. You don't need to write the code to deallocate the memory. But when we dynamically allocate the memory like Student* lee=new Student();. It means that we 
dynamically allocate the memory (new is the keyword), hence we need to delete the student. delete lee. When we have a array we need to delete[] int. For example
int* arr=new int(10);
