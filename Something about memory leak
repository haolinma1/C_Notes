When we create a pointer that point to another object, we need to remember free the memory. For example I have a pointer MenuItem* menuItem,
When I store the memory of a dynamically MenuItem object like menuItem=new MenuItem(content), In this case, we have dynamically create a MenuItem
by using new and store the memory to menuItem. Hence, in the destructor of the Menu, we need to deallocate this memory by delete menuItem. 
In my own understanding, we need to delete the new MenuItem(content) by this way to free all the memory
