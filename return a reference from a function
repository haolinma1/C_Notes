When we want to return a reference from a function like const char& Text::operator[](int index)const this prototype. We should be careful, Remember! we can't return 
any reference that is created in this function since the variables in this function will be destroyed after the function end, and the complier cannot recognize it.
The variable is dead! Hence, we should always return the reference that is global (declare in header file)
